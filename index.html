    <h4><b>Rent control</b> is effective at keeping people in their homes. Rent control policies limit rent increases and provide greater housing stability for tenants. Rent control ordinances in California allow landlords to set the initial rent in any amount, but limit rent increases after a tenancy begins. </h4>
    <h4>Rent control is often combined with eviction protections, known as <b>"just cause for eviction,"</b> to make sure that landlords do not get around the rent increase limits by simply evicting tenants arbitrarily and bringing in new tenants. Just Cause protections provide basic fairness and prevent retaliation, discrimination, and harassment proactively.</h4>

    <td>The Oakland Rent Adjustment Ordinance (O.M.C. 8.22.070) allows an annual rent increase based on the regional Consumer Price Index (“CPI”).
      The “CPI rate” takes effect on each July 1 and remains in effect through June 30 of the following year. A property owner can raise rent 
      above the CPI rate. 
      One justification is “banking”.<p> “Banking” refers to deferred allowed annual rent increases. 
      These annual rent increases are determined by the City and are also known as CPI increases
      or annual general rent increases. Annual rent increases 
      that were not given, or were not given in full, can be carried forward to future years. 
      Subject to certain limitations, property
      owners may defer giving annual general increases up to ten years.
      General increases that were not imposed within ten years expire. 
      If challenged, evidence of the rental history of the subject unit is required.</p>
